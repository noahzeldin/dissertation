This repository holds the code related to the statistical analyses included in 
the second chapter of my dissertation: "Agitation and Intervention: *[The Measures Taken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(play))* and 
*[The Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_(Brecht_play))*." These 
two major works were collaborations between German dramatist 
[Bertolt Brecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht) 
and Austro-German composer 
[Hanns Eisler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Eisler), completed in the 
final years of the Weimar Republic.

* The first is a formal analysis of Eisler's music for *The Measures Taken*. 

  + The code is available [here](https://github.com/noahzeldin/dissertation/blob/main/mt_music_analysis.md). 

  + An excerpt from the corresponding write-up included in my dissertation is available [here](https://github.com/noahzeldin/dissertation/blob/main/mt_music_analysis_write_up.md).

* The second is a quantitative analysis of over 120 articles on *The Measures 
Taken* and *The Mother* from the notoriously partisan press of the Weimar 
Republic.

  + The code is available [here](https://github.com/noahzeldin/dissertation/blob/main/reception_analysis.md).
  
  + The corresponding write-up included in my dissertation is available [here](https://github.com/noahzeldin/dissertation/blob/main/reception_analysis_write_up.md).

All analyses were conducted in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and all code is 
written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
