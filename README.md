# The Learning-Piece, from the Weimar Republic to the Postwar Era: A Critical-Historical Reassessment

## NOTE: This page is IN PROGRESS. I am currently uploading preliminary versions of the lab reports.

This repository holds the coding related to the statistical analyses included in 
the second chapter of my dissertation, "Agitation and Intervention: *The Measures 
Taken* and *The Mother*."

The first is a formal analysis of Hanns Eisler's music to *The Measures Taken* 
[*Die Ma√ünahme*]. The second is a quantitative analysis of over 120 articles on 
*The Measures Taken* and *The Mother* [*Die Mutter*] from the press of the Weimar 
Republic.
